        Hello,

        On behalf of the FLDC team, THANK YOU for submitting your "[node:title]" session to Florida DrupalCamp [config_page:camp_details:field_camp_year]. We are beyond grateful and appreciative.

        Keep in mind, we are IN PERSON this year in Orlando, Florida. We expect all attendees to be vaccinated against Covid.

        Your session is viewable at [node:url] and you may edit it at [node:edit-url].

        Important: Please be sure to fill out all fields (including photo, bio, etc) in your user profile at [current-user:edit-url].

        A speaker FAQ including important dates is available at [site:url]speaker-info. Reply to this email if you have any additional questions. 

        Thanks again,

        The Florida DrupalCamp planning team
